## With this method you can add what mod you want, but there are more simple method to download or create a modpack :

+ ### Curseforge

   This is the the most famous. [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/) has a massive library of mods/modpack/textures packs/map. You have a luncher with that you can download [here](https://download.curseforge.com/)

+ ### Modrinth

      Modrinth is a little bit different, it’s offer praticly the sames mods that cursesforge, but certains mods that aren’t in curseforge are present [here](https://modrinth.com/).

      You can download them with a luncher like [Prism Luncher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

+ ### Technic

   [Technic](https://www.technicpack.net/dashboard) is the worse internet site of this list because it’s instable (having multiples issues with them). But this support site for modpack offers to customer to have mods like optifine that  never be added in Modrinth or Curseforge. You have a Technic luncher but I tested it on Macos it’ s functionnal but not ergonomic or estethic. Maybe over time I'll change my mind.

### The principal mods (present in fews modpacks) :

# Create

# Usage

### Pushing and Pulling Entities

When powered by Rotational Force, an Encased Fan creates an air stream that extends several blocks in front of it. This air stream pushes entities away from the fan or pulls entities towards it depending on the direction of the rotation that the fan receives. Powering an Encased Fan with faster rotational force will cause its air stream to be stronger and faster.

   ### Wrench

   Shift-right-clicking on a Mechanical Drill with a [Wrench](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Wrench) will destroy the Mechanical Drill and place it in your inventory.

+ # Breaking ~~Bad~~ Blocks

   A stationary Mechanical Drill will break blocks in the block in front of it with a time in seconds of (45 x Hardness)/RPM and will hurt entities in an area around it.

   A Mechanical Drill moved by [Contraptions](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Contraption) will break blocks and damage entities with which it collides without needing a direct supply of [Rotational Force](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Rotational_Force).

   The time it takes for a Mechanical Drill to break a block is based on the [Contraption](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Contraption)'s speed and the block's Hardness value. The damage dealt to entities is also based on the [Contraption](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Contraption)'s speed.

   The Deployer can be given items to use with machines or by right clicking the items into the hand.

   The Deployer can be stopped with a Redstone signal.

   The Filter on the side of the Deployer can be adjusted to only use certain items. The filter is also essential when using a Deployer in a Contraption.

   The Deployer has 2 inventory slots; the held item and one extra internal slot. As well as unusable items, items harvested by the Deployer will be transferred to the extra slot to be removed by machines, during which time the Deployer will stall. Items cannot be extracted from the extra slot directly by the player.

   The Deployer simulates right clicks by default. It can be adjusted to left click instead by right clicking the front with a Wrench. While in left-click mode, the Deployer can use normal tools, such as pickaxes and swords. The tools will behave as if the player was holding them, including mobs dropping rare items when slain by a Deployer.

   The Hand Crank will rotate at 32RPM for around 0.5 seconds. One usage of the Hand Crank will rotate a Mechanical Bearing connected 1:1 90°.

   Use of the Hand Crank will deplete hunger.

   # Steam Engine

The **Steam Engine** is a block that provides Rotational Force. It has the highest Stress (SU) capacity of all the survival-mode power-generating blocks. It converts the pressure caused by heating Water in a Fluid Tank into Rotational Force, allowing for large scale item production and multiple contraptions.

+ # Usage

   Steam Engines use heated Water for power and are placed on Fluid Tanks used as a boiler. At least 4 Fluid Tanks and 1 heat source block are required. A Shaft can be used on the engine to make a kinetic output. The direction of the output can be adjusted through the Value Settings on the side of the engine.

   Increasing the total power generated requires that one or more of the three characteristics (heat, size, water) of the Fluid Tank boiler be increased. Multiple Steam Engines can be attached to a single boiler to extract more power; however, this will not increase the total power generated by the boiler.

   ## Heat

   All passive heat sources generate the same amount of heat. More power can be generated with the help of Blaze Burners, which produce varying amounts of heat depending on their state. Adding additional fluid tanks and water-input pipes can also generate more power. At higher power levels, more Steam Engines are required to extract rotational power from the boiler.

   # Schematic Cannon

> The **Schematicannon** is a special type of machine used to build structures with the use of Schematics. It is a useful contraption which is primarily used within Survival Mode to deploy structures block-by-block, as the function of direct placement for Schematics are limited exclusively to Creative Mode.

+ # Usage
   + ## Common processing

   A Schematic must first be positioned in the world before being placed in the cannon. Position the Schematic by right clicking. While holding the schematic, the selection and a control menu can be viewed.

   The cannon will take the blocks required to build the structure from any adjacent inventories. The cannon will accept any inventory-type block as long as it has the function to output its contents.

   The cannon feeds on Gunpowder, consuming once for every 400 blocks. The slot for gunpowder is located in the upper left segment of the menu, and may hold up to a stack at any given period. The cannon may consume up to 5 gunpowder when powered for the first time, and will have a bar for a fuel indicator next to the input slot.

# Industrial Reborn

> Industrial Reborn is a mod that adds many electric machines, new blocks, and items to modern versions of Minecraft. The inspiration for this mod is the well-known Industrial Craft 2 Exp, but it has its own changes, improvements and adjustments. This mod allows you to automate tasks, create generators, and connect machines to power them.

+ # Installation

   To install this mod, you need to have Minecraft Forge or Fabric installed on your Minecraft launcher. Then, download the latest version of Industrial Reborn from [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-reborn/files) or [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/industrial-reborn). Place the downloaded file in your mods folder and launch the game.

+ # Features

   #### This mod adds a variety of features, such as:

   - **Generators**: These are machines that produce electricity from different sources, such as coal, lava, wind, water, or solar panels. You can use them to power your machines and devices.
   - **Machines**: These are devices that perform various tasks, such as smelting ores, crushing items, compressing blocks, extracting fluids, or crafting items. You can use them to process your resources and create new products.
   - **Cables**: These are wires that transfer electricity from generators to machines. You can use them to connect your devices and create networks.
   - **Modules**: These are items that can be inserted into machines or cables to enhance their performance or functionality. You can use them to upgrade your devices and customize your system.
   - **Tools**: These are items that can help you with various tasks, such as wrenches, hammers, cutters, or scanners. You can use them to interact with your devices and obtain information.

   Sure, I can expand the features description with more examples. Here you go:

   - **Generators**: These are machines that produce electricity from different sources, such as coal, lava, wind, water, or solar panels. You can use them to power your machines and devices. Some examples of generators are:
      - **Coal Generator**: This generator burns coal to produce electricity. It is cheap and easy to make, but it consumes fuel and produces pollution.
      - **Lava Generator**: This generator uses lava buckets to produce electricity. It is more efficient and clean than the coal generator, but it requires a constant supply of lava.
      - **Wind Turbine**: This generator uses wind to produce electricity. It is free and renewable, but it depends on the weather and the height of the turbine.
      - **Water Wheel**: This generator uses flowing water to produce electricity. It is also free and renewable, but it requires a water source and a suitable terrain.
      - **Solar Panel**: This generator uses sunlight to produce electricity. It is the most efficient and clean generator, but it only works during the day and under clear skies.
   - **Machines**: These are devices that perform various tasks, such as smelting ores, crushing items, compressing blocks, extracting fluids, or crafting items. You can use them to process your resources and create new products. Some examples of machines are:
      - **Electric Furnace**: This machine smelts items using electricity. It is faster and more efficient than a regular furnace, but it requires power to work.
      - **Crusher**: This machine crushes items into smaller pieces or dusts. It can be used to double your ore output or create new materials.
      - **Compressor**: This machine compresses items into blocks or plates. It can be used to save space or create new items.
      - **Fluid Extractor**: This machine extracts fluids from items or blocks. It can be used to obtain liquids such as water, lava, oil, or honey.
      - **Auto Crafter**: This machine crafts items using recipes from a crafting table. It can be used to automate your crafting process or create complex items.
   - **Cables**: These are wires that transfer electricity from generators to machines. You can use them to connect your devices and create networks. Some examples of cables are:
      - **Copper Cable**: This cable transfers electricity at a low rate. It is cheap and easy to make, but it has high energy loss and low capacity.
      - **Iron Cable**: This cable transfers electricity at a medium rate. It is more expensive and harder to make than the copper cable, but it has lower energy loss and higher capacity.
      - **Gold Cable**: This cable transfers electricity at a high rate. It is very expensive and difficult to make than the iron cable, but it has very low energy loss and very high capacity.
   - **Modules**: These are items that can be inserted into machines or cables to enhance their performance or functionality. You can use them to upgrade your devices and customize your system. Some examples of modules are:
      - **Speed Module**: This module increases the speed of a machine or a cable. It can be used to make your devices work faster, but it also increases their power consumption.
      - **Efficiency Module**: This module decreases the power consumption of a machine or a cable. It can be used to make your devices use less energy, but it also decreases their speed.
      - **Storage Module**: This module increases the storage capacity of a machine or a battery box. It can be used to make your devices hold more items or energy, but it also increases their weight.
      - **Transfer Module**: This module increases the transfer rate of a cable or a fluid pipe. It can be used to make your devices transfer more energy or fluid per tick, but it also increases their energy loss or fluid spillage.
      - **Filter Module**: This module allows you to filter the items or fluids that pass through a machine or a pipe. It can be used to sort your resources or prevent unwanted items or fluids from entering your system.
   - **Tools**: These are items that can help you with various tasks, such as wrenches, hammers, cutters, or scanners. You can use them to interact with your devices and obtain information. Some examples of tools are:
      - **Wrench**: This tool allows you to rotate, dismantle, or configure your machines or cables. You can use it to change the direction of your devices or remove them without breaking them.
      - **Hammer**: This tool allows you to hammer items into plates or wires. You can use it to create new materials for crafting or wiring.
+ # Examples

   #### Here are some examples of how you can use this mod:

   - To create a basic coal generator, you need to craft a machine casing, a furnace, a battery box, and a coal generator block. Then, place the coal generator block on top of the machine casing and the battery box next to it. Connect them with a copper cable and insert some coal into the generator. The generator will start producing electricity and storing it in the battery box.
   - To create a basic electric furnace, you need to craft a machine casing, an electric furnace block, and an iron furnace. Then, place the electric furnace block on top of the machine casing and the iron furnace next to it. Connect them with a copper cable and insert some items into the iron furnace. The electric furnace will start smelting the items using electricity from the cable.
   - To create a basic solar panel, you need to craft a machine casing, a solar panel block, and four glass panes. Then, place the solar panel block on top of the machine casing and surround it with glass panes. Connect it with a copper cable and place it under direct sunlight. The solar panel will start producing electricity when exposed to light.
+ # Comparisons

   #### Here are some comparisons of how this mod differs from Industrial Craft 2 Exp:

   - This mod uses a simpler energy system that does not require transformers or converters. All machines and cables use the same voltage and can be connected without problems.
   - This mod has fewer machines and items than Industrial Craft 2 Exp, but it focuses on quality over quantity. The machines have more animations, sounds, and effects than Industrial Craft 2 Exp.
   - This mod has more modules than Industrial Craft 2 Exp, which can be used to modify machines or cables in various ways. The modules have more effects and interactions than Industrial Craft 2 Exp.

## Informations :

+ ### Generation

   > Pendorite ore only generates in the [Embur Bog](https://oh-the-biomes-youll-go.fandom.com/wiki/Embur_Bog) biome below y=56.

   > In Embur Bog biomes, pendorite ores are pretty common on the ceiling, so it's recommended to look up there. Towering towards the ores is gonna be easy, because of the insta-breakable yellow gel blocks that generate on top of the "trees".

+ ### Obtaining

   > May be broken with a diamond pickaxe or better

   > Drops raw pendorite and must be turned into pendorite scraps

+ ### Crafting

   Four pendorite scraps, two diamonds, and two [emeraldite](https://oh-the-biomes-youll-go.fandom.com/wiki/Emeraldite) shards are required to craft a [pendorite ingot](https://oh-the-biomes-youll-go.fandom.com/wiki/Pendorite_Ingot), which may be combined with a netherite tool in a smithing table to produce a pendorite tool.

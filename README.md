# WIKIS

Wikis is a project to create fancy documentation and tutorials to help Minecraft players.

# Why?

When you search on the internet for how to fix my crashing modpack, you have a lot of tutorials for a special crash/bug, this project is here to help the player with any of his crashes.

# Posting it on GitHub?

I write all the documentation on an app called [craft.do](https://www.craft.do/) this fancy software is notion-like and the app support markdown. The goal is that if you want to add your experience or explanation, you can make that with Github.

# What is the progress of the project?

Currently, I just write resolving crashes with a modpack in the French language. Which is my main language. But with your help, we can make it in different languages ;)
